[0.862s] [0mCMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:16 (cmake_policy):
[0.862s]   The OLD behavior for policy CMP0042 will be removed from a future version
[0.862s]   of CMake.
[0.862s] 
[0.862s]   The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
[0.862s]   policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
[0.862s]   specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
[0.862s]   behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

[0mCMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:7 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.

[0mCMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:16 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0042 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

  By not providing "FindAirPcap.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "AirPcap", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "AirPcap" with any

  Add the installation prefix of "AirPcap" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "AirPcap_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "AirPcap" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
